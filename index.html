<p>I am Eduardo, a Software Development student who is excited about this new chapter in my life.</p>

    <p>I am currently studying software development for the first time. 
     It has been a few years since I have been engaged in academics, so this feels very new to me and it is taking me
     a while to get back to being comfortable being a student again.
     One of the things that attracts me to software development is that it can be done almost anywhere
     you have a computer and electricity. <br><br>
     The program that I'm enrolled in is very challenging as you will see in the following list.
    </p>

<h3>Tecnologies that I'm learning</h3>
<ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
    <li>JavaScript, JSON</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>OOP, Ruby, SQL, ORM</li>
    <li>Rails</li>
</ul>

    <p>Soon I'll be working on your projecs!</p>
